#Specifies the number of SNPs that we want LASSO to select into the model during each run. A good choice of q might gurantee that 0.15<q^2/(p*2)<0.3 (at most 0.5) based on expriences. For example, if q=200, then q^2/(p*2)= 0.197

should be a conservative choice for our data. To be more liberal, we may use efp=5.

#result$freq is the selection frequencies for each SNP. The bigger the frequency, the better evidence that this SNP is associated with the phenotype

#result$markersig is the significant SNPs judged by the stability selection criteria, e.g. to allow number of efp to be smaller than 5
